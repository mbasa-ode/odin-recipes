                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and

            <li>
                While potatoes cook, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. 
                Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in 
                hot water for 10 to 12 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop eggs. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the potatoes, eggs, celery, onion, relish, mayonnaise, mustard, 
                garlic salt, celery salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix together well and
