        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. 
                Saute onion and celery until tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add broccoli and broth, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. 
                Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully 
                start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before 
                leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. 
                Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and puree the soup right 
                in the cooking pot.
            </li>

                Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium to 
                medium-low heat; stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick and bubbly, and 
                add to soup. Season with pepper and serve. 
            </li>

                Serve hot and enjoy!
