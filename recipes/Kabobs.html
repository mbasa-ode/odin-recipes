        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix teriyaki sauce, honey, garlic powder, and ginger in a large resealable 
                plastic bag. Place chicken, beef, red bell peppers, onion wedges, and 
                mushrooms in the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and 
                seal the bag. Refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Discard marinade. Thread meat and vegetables onto skewers, leaving a 
                small space between each item.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grill skewers, turning as needed, until meat is cooked through and 
                vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
